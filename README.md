## User stories for release:

  

### Sprint 1:

Infrastructure: create a GitHub repository and have everyone on the team clone it on their unique devices and create their own branch, this repo needs react library installed

Spike: youtube: React Native, Expo, JavaScript, cache system with mobile apps? To cache RNG ID

(3) User story 1: As someone who gets confused easily, I want a basic UI that is able to display my tasks so that I can examine everything I’ve entered into my checklist.

(3) User story 2: As someone who has a lot of tasks to remember before leaving the house, I would like a way to add or remove tasks to my checklist so that I can keep track of the things I need to remember before leaving the house.

### Sprint 2:

Spike: google map API

(3) User story 1: As a person who leaves the house often, I want a way to log my home location so that my checklist resets whenever I arrive home.

(5) User story 2: As someone who leaves the house often, I want the app to automatically detect when I’m close to my house so that I don’t have to manually inform the app that I’m home.

(3) User story 3: As a forgetful person, I want my checklist to be locked when I’m out of the house and unlocked when I arrive home so that I don’t second guess myself on the tasks I have listed.

### Sprint 3:

Spike: database? (Firebase)

(?) User story 1: As an individual who cares about visuals, I want the app to be more user-friendly and look more appealing so that it’s easier to look at and navigate around.

(?) User story 2: As someone with a family, I want the app to have an option where I can add family members to the same task list and have our tasks sync properly so that I can see if anyone in the family is forgetting to do something before they leave the house. 


### Sprint 4:

Spike: more database?

(?) User story 1: As someone with multiple homes, I want the option to log multiple homes so that I can keep track of the tasks I need to complete before leaving each home.

(?) User story 2: As someone with multiple homes, I want access to multiple checklists so that my tasks don't get mixed up between each house.
