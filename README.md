# CSE 115A Project
**Team**:  SafeHouse Keepers 

**Product Name**: SafeHouse 

Release Name: Build 1

Release Date: End of Fall Quarter 

Revision Number: 1

Revision Date: October 6, 2021


## Description:
SafeHouse is an application developed the common problem of forgetting to do some task before leaving your home.
The application allows users to create a list of tasks/reminders and allows users to check tasks off as they are completed.
Once the user has left the set 'home' location, the list becomes uneditable to stop users from making changes.
This way users can see the tasks they have not yet completed, and eliminate the second guessing when the users are no longer at home.


## High-level goals:
* Allow for a unique and customizable experience for each user with regards to the checklist functionality
* Automate the process of arriving to/departing a home location through location tracking using Google Maps API
* Create a lock/unlocking feature of the checklist which activates upon leaving/arriving home to prevent second-guessing

## User stories for release:
### Sprint 1:

Infrastructure: create a GitHub repository and have everyone on the team clone it on their unique devices and create their own branch, this repo needs react library installed

Spike: youtube: React Native, Expo, JavaScript, cache system with mobile apps? To cache RNG ID

(3) User story 1: As someone who gets confused easily, I want a basic UI that is able to display my tasks so that I can examine everything I’ve entered into my checklist.

(3) User story 2: As someone who has a lot of tasks to remember before leaving the house, I would like a way to add or remove tasks to my checklist so that I can keep track of the things I need to remember before leaving the house.

### Sprint 2:

Spike: google map API

(3) User story 1: As a person who leaves the house often, I want a way to log my home location so that my checklist resets whenever I arrive home.

(5) User story 2: As someone who leaves the house often, I want the app to automatically detect when I’m close to my house so that I don’t have to manually inform the app that I’m home.

(3) User story 3: As a forgetful person, I want my checklist to be locked when I’m out of the house and unlocked when I arrive home so that I don’t second guess myself on the tasks I have listed.

User story 4/Backlog: As an average mobile user, I want to have an intuitive UI where I can understand where to access everything from account and location settings and tasks. 

### Sprint 3:

Spike: database? (Firebase) caching?

(3) User story 1: As an individual who cares about visuals, I want the app to be more user-friendly and look more appealing so that it’s easier to look at and navigate around.

(3) User Story 3: As someone who might not always have a stabile connection to the internet, I want ot be able to have my information saved saved without the internet so that I can still use the application.

(3) User Story 5: As a forgetful person, I want my checklist to be locked when I'm out of the house and unlocked when I arrive home so that I don't second guess myself on the tasks I have listed.



### Sprint 4:
Spike: more database?

(5) User Story 1: As someone with a family, I want the app to have an option where I can add family members to the same task list and have our tasks sync properly so that I can see if anyone in the family is forgetting to do something before they leave the house.

(5) User story 2: As someone with multiple homes, I want the option to log multiple homes so that I can keep track of the tasks I need to complete before leaving each home.

(3) User story 3: User Story 3: As someone who cares about my privacy, I want to be able to log out of the application so that others cannot use my account while accessing the application.
